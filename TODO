////// Priority
* gpg sig for database

////// Fix/improve
* on search.php, make a search with filter on owner
* when you follow a link and you're not logged in, you want to be redirected to the target page after login
* get config file path in .ini to be able to store it elsewhere
* editable list of status
* add tag on templates

////// New Features
* use this http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home to compile js
* read only status for past members
* have real auth with LDAP etc... like here : http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Authentication
* have a visibility status for experiments : hidden (only you), team, public (don't need account to read it)
