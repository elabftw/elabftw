        body: |
          <h1>Synthesis and Characterization of a Novel Organic Compound with Antimicrobial Properties</h1>
          <p>
          The emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains has become a major public health concern, highlighting the need for the development of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, we aimed to synthesize a novel organic compound with potential antimicrobial activity.
          </p>
          <h2>Experimental Design</h2>
          <p>
          The compound was synthesized via a multi-step reaction scheme. The starting material, benzaldehyde, was reacted with aniline in the presence of an acid catalyst to form the intermediate product, N-phenylbenzamide. The intermediate product was then reacted with thionyl chloride to form the corresponding acid chloride. The acid chloride was then reacted with aminoguanidine in the presence of a base catalyst to form the final product, which was purified by recrystallization.
          </p>
          <h2>Characterization</h2>
          <p>
          The synthesized compound was characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. The melting point of the compound was determined using a melting point apparatus and compared to the literature value. The IR spectrum of the compound was obtained using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and compared to the expected spectrum. The NMR spectrum of the compound was obtained using a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer and analyzed to confirm the structure of the compound.
          </p>
          <h2>Antimicrobial Activity</h2>
          <p>
          The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compound was evaluated against several bacterial strains using the disk diffusion method. The results showed that the compound exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting its potential as a new antimicrobial agent.

      - title: Effect of temperature on enzyme activity
        user: 2
        body: |
          <h1>Effect of Temperature on Enzyme Activity</h1>
          <p>
          Enzymes are biological molecules that catalyze chemical reactions in living organisms. In this experiment, we investigated the effect of temperature on the activity of the enzyme amylase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch into glucose.
          </p>
          <h2>Experimental Design</h2>
          <p>
          We prepared a solution of starch and added a small amount of amylase to the solution. We then incubated the solution at different temperatures, ranging from 4°C to 70°C, for 5 minutes. After the incubation period, we added iodine to the solution to detect the presence of starch. The disappearance of the blue-black color of the iodine indicated the breakdown of starch into glucose.
          </p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
          The results showed that the activity of amylase increased with increasing temperature up to 37°C, which is the optimum temperature for amylase activity. At temperatures above 37°C, the activity of amylase decreased rapidly, and at 70°C, the enzyme was completely denatured and lost its catalytic activity.
          </p>
          <p>
          The relationship between temperature and enzyme activity can be described by the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant of a reaction to the activation energy and temperature. The equation can be written as:
          </p>
          <p>
          $$k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}$$
          </p>
          <p>
          where k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, E_a is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The activation energy is the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and form the products. The rate constant increases with increasing temperature due to the increase in the number of reactant molecules with sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy barrier.
          </p>
          <p>
          The effect of temperature on enzyme activity can also be described by the Q10 value, which is the ratio of the reaction rate at a given temperature to the reaction rate at a temperature 10°C lower. The Q10 value for most enzyme-catalyzed reactions is around 2-3, indicating that the reaction rate doubles or triples with each 10°C increase in temperature.

      - title: Testing relationship between acceleration and gravity
        body: |
          <h1>Determination of Acceleration Due to Gravity</h1>
          <p>
          The acceleration due to gravity is a fundamental constant that determines the gravitational force between two objects. In this experiment, we aimed to determine the value of acceleration due to gravity using a simple pendulum.
          </p>
          <h2>Experimental Design</h2>
          <p>
          We suspended a metal ball from a string and measured the time taken for one complete oscillation of the pendulum. We repeated this measurement for different lengths of the pendulum and recorded the corresponding times. Using the formula $T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$, where $T$ is the period of the pendulum, $L$ is the length of the pendulum, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, we calculated the value of $g$. The period $T$ can also be expressed in terms of the frequency $f$ using the equation $T=\frac{1}{f}$.
          </p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
          The results showed that the value of acceleration due to gravity was $9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$, which is consistent with the accepted value. We also found that the period of the pendulum increased with increasing length, as predicted by the formula $T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$. The relationship between the length and period of the pendulum can be expressed as $T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{g}L$, which is a linear relationship with a slope of $\frac{4\pi^2}{g}$.

      - title: Synthesis of Aspirin
        user: 3
        body: |
          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
          Aspirin is a widely used pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory drug. In this experiment, we aimed to synthesize aspirin from salicylic acid and acetic anhydride.
          </p>
          <h2>Experimental Design</h2>
          <p>
          We mixed salicylic acid and acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst, sulfuric acid. The reaction produced aspirin and acetic acid, as shown in the following chemical equation:
          </p>
          <p>
          $$\ce{C7H6O3 + (CH3CO)2O ->[\text{H2SO4}] C9H8O4 + CH3COOH}$$
          </p>
          <p>
          After the reaction, we purified the aspirin by recrystallization from hot water. The purity of the aspirin was confirmed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and melting point analysis.
          </p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
          The yield of aspirin was 80% based on the amount of salicylic acid used. The purity of the aspirin was confirmed using TLC, which showed a single spot corresponding to aspirin. The melting point of the aspirin was 135-136°C, which is consistent with the literature value of 135-136.5°C.
          </p>
          <p>
          The chemical reaction involved in the synthesis of aspirin can be written as:
          </p>
          <p>
          $$\ce{C7H6O3 + (CH3CO)2O ->[\text{H2SO4}] C9H8O4 + CH3COOH}$$
          </p>
          <p>
          The theoretical yield of aspirin can be calculated using the stoichiometry of the reaction. Assuming that all the salicylic acid reacts and no aspirin is lost during the purification process, the theoretical yield is calculated as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
          $$\text{Theoretical yield} = \frac{\text{moles of salicylic acid used}}{\text{molar ratio of salicylic acid to aspirin}} \times \text{molar mass of aspirin}$$
          </p>
          <p>
          The actual yield of aspirin can be calculated by dividing the mass of the purified aspirin by the mass of salicylic acid used and multiplying by 100%. The percent yield can be calculated by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and multiplying by 100%.

      - title: Schrödinger's Cat Thought Experiment
        tags:
          - theory
          - quantum physics
        body: |
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>To conceptually explore the principles of quantum superposition and observation through the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat thought experiment, which illustrates the paradox of a system being in multiple states simultaneously until observed.</p>
            <h2>Materials (Theoretical)</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>A sealed box</li>
            <li>A cat (hypothetical)</li>
            <li>A radioactive atom (<em>e.g.</em>, Cesium-137)</li>
            <li>Geiger counter</li>
            <li>Hammer mechanism</li>
            <li>Vial of poison (<em>e.g.</em>, hydrocyanic acid)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>Place the cat, Geiger counter, radioactive atom, hammer, and poison vial inside the sealed box.</li>
            <li>If the Geiger counter detects a decay event, it triggers the hammer to break the vial, releasing poison.</li>
            <li>Leave the box sealed to isolate the system from observation.</li>
            <li>According to quantum mechanics, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead until the box is opened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Expected Results</h2>
            <p>Since the experiment is theoretical, no empirical data is collected. However, it leads to a dual-state interpretation&mdash;alive and dead&mdash;based on the principles of quantum superposition.</p>
            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>Schrödinger's cat is not a real experiment but a critique of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. It raises questions about the role of the observer in determining reality and highlights challenges in interpreting quantum states at the macroscopic scale.</p>
      - title: Quantum Entanglement with Photons
        body: |
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>To generate and measure entangled photon pairs to demonstrate nonlocal correlations violating Bell’s inequalities.</p>
          <h2>Materials (Theoretical)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Laser source</li>
            <li>Nonlinear crystal for SPDC</li>
            <li>Beam splitters and mirrors</li>
            <li>Polarizers</li>
            <li>Single-photon detectors</li>
            <li>Coincidence counter module</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Procedure</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Direct the laser into the SPDC crystal to produce entangled photons.</li>
            <li>Separate photon pairs using beam splitters and optical paths.</li>
            <li>Place polarizers at variable angles before each detector.</li>
            <li>Record coincidence counts for each polarizer-angle combination.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Expected Results</h2>
          <p>Correlation rates that violate classical bounds, confirming the existence of quantum entanglement.</p>
          <h2>Discussion</h2>
          <p>This experiment tests the nonlocal nature of quantum mechanics and rules out local hidden-variable models by comparing measured correlations against Bell’s inequalities.</p>

      - title: Double-Slit Experiment with Electrons
        body: |
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>To observe the wave–particle duality of electrons by demonstrating an interference pattern in a double-slit apparatus at low electron flux.</p>
          <h2>Materials (Theoretical)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Electron gun</li>
            <li>Vacuum chamber</li>
            <li>Double-slit barrier</li>
            <li>Phosphor screen or CCD detector</li>
            <li>Electron optics system</li>
            <li>Data acquisition system</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Procedure</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Evacuate the chamber to high vacuum.</li>
            <li>Emit electrons one at a time toward the double-slit barrier.</li>
            <li>Collect arrival positions of electrons on the detector.</li>
            <li>Aggregate many events to reveal interference fringes.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Expected Results</h2>
          <p>An interference pattern emerges over time, indicating wave-like behavior despite discrete detection events.</p>
          <h2>Discussion</h2>
          <p>Demonstrates fundamental quantum superposition: each electron interferes with itself, challenging classical intuitions about particle trajectories.</p>

      - title: Quantum Tunneling through a Potential Barrier
        body: |
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>To illustrate quantum tunneling by measuring the transmission probability of particles through a one-dimensional potential barrier.</p>
          <h2>Materials (Theoretical)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Particle beam source (e.g., electrons)</li>
            <li>Vacuum tube with controllable potential barrier</li>
            <li>Electrostatic barrier plates</li>
            <li>Particle detectors before and after the barrier</li>
            <li>Voltage supply</li>
            <li>Counting electronics</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Procedure</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Set barrier height and width via plate voltages.</li>
            <li>Direct a low-energy particle beam at the barrier.</li>
            <li>Measure transmitted and reflected particle counts.</li>
            <li>Repeat for different barrier parameters.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Expected Results</h2>
          <p>Non-zero transmission probability even when particle energy is below barrier height, in agreement with tunneling predictions.</p>
          <h2>Discussion</h2>
          <p>Highlights a purely quantum phenomenon where particles penetrate classically forbidden regions, with transmission decreasing exponentially with barrier width.</p>

      - title: Rabi Oscillations in a Two-Level System
        body: |
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>To characterize coherent Rabi oscillations by driving transitions between two quantum states with a resonant electromagnetic field.</p>
          <h2>Materials (Theoretical)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Two-level atomic or spin system (e.g., trapped ions, NV centers)</li>
            <li>Microwave or RF source</li>
            <li>Pulse generator</li>
            <li>State detection apparatus</li>
            <li>Magnetic or optical trapping setup</li>
            <li>Timing and control electronics</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Procedure</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Prepare the system in the ground state.</li>
            <li>Apply a resonant pulse of variable duration.</li>
            <li>Measure population in the excited state after each pulse.</li>
            <li>Plot excited-state probability vs. pulse duration.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Expected Results</h2>
          <p>Oscillatory population transfer (sinusoidal) between states, with frequency proportional to drive amplitude.</p>
          <h2>Discussion</h2>
          <p>Demonstrates coherent control of quantum states, fundamental for qubit manipulation in quantum computing.</p>

      - title: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle Demonstration
        body: |
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>To experimentally illustrate the uncertainty relation between position and momentum measurements of single particles.</p>
          <h2>Materials (Theoretical)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Particle beam source</li>
            <li>Narrow slits of varying widths</li>
            <li>Position-sensitive detector</li>
            <li>Vacuum chamber</li>
            <li>Data acquisition system</li>
            <li>Precision alignment stages</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Procedure</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Collimate beam and direct through a slit of known width.</li>
            <li>Measure angular spread (momentum distribution) on detector.</li>
            <li>Repeat for different slit widths.</li>
            <li>Analyze variance in position vs. momentum distributions.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Expected Results</h2>
          <p>Inverse relationship: narrower slits yield broader momentum spread, illustrating Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2.</p>
          <h2>Discussion</h2>
          <p>Confirms a cornerstone of quantum theory: precise knowledge of one observable limits knowledge of its conjugate.</p>
