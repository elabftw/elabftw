# Description

**eLabFTW** is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams.

It lets you store and organize your research experiments easily. It also features a database where any kind of objects (such as antibodies, plasmids, cell lines, boxes, _etc_.) can be stored.
It is accessed _via_ the browser. Several research teams can be hosted on the same installation. This means **eLabFTW** can be installed at the institute level and host all team members at the same place. This is what is done at in many research institutions around the globe. It is also a great solution for companies looking into improving the traceability and reproducibility of their processes.

## Features

* Lab notebook for experiments
* Database for lab reagents, equipment, storage, cell lines, etc...
* Trusted timestamping
* Blockchain timestamping
* Import and export in various formats
* Calendar to manage booking of equipment
* Support for various scientific file formats
* Molecule/equation editor
* LaTeX support
* Todolist
* Public REST API
* Available in 17 languages
* Advanced permissions system
* Audited, secure codebase suitable for sensitive research results

## How it works

**eLabFTW** is designed to be installed on a server, and people from the team can log in from their browser.

# Installation

**eLabFTW** can easily be installed on any GNU/Linux server. It requires at least 512 MB of RAM (1 GB recommended) and 300 MB of disk space. Installation is done through Docker, so [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) needs to be installed on the server. Since it runs in a Docker container, php, webservers or mysql do not have to be installed on your server.  Everything is provided by the containers so different versions and extensions do not matter. This makes upgrading versions much easier.

The documentation explains everything:
