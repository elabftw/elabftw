# eLabFTW TRADEMARKS POLICY

## The eLabFTW Trademark

The brand and word "eLabFTW" has trade mark protection in many countries around
the world. Various eLabFTW™ trade marks are owned by Deltablot SASU. The law obligates
trade mark owners to police their trade marks and prevent the use of
confusingly similar names by third parties.

We need to be clear about use of the word "eLabFTW" and how we restrict its use
when promoting commercial eLabFTW™ branded services. The proper use of
trade marks reliably assures consumers about the quality of the associated
products or services and where they have been derived from. Because eLabFTW
is made available under the open source ‘GNU Affero General Public License'
that permits you to modify the copyrighted software, the distribution of such
modified software in combination with eLabFTW trade marks can potentially
mislead others in the community. To be clear, the GNU AGPL does not include an
implied right or licence to use eLabFTW's trade marks.

We do all this to protect the very business model that allows us to continue
developing eLabFTW for you.

You can **freely use** what is included in this git repository under its
opensource license, either for a non-commercial purposes, or for commercial purposes
as long as you replace trademarked content (including without limitation the
eLabFTW name and logo).

## Allowed uses of "eLabFTW"

The following uses don't require any permission at all:

* Referring to the software or the eLabFTW project as the "eLabFTW™ software"
  or the "eLabFTW™ project"
* Describing your own implementation of the eLabFTW™ software platform
  (including within corporate settings).
* Describing a eLabFTW-based community hub.
* Describing certain software you've made that integrates with eLabFTW™
  branded software (e.g. a eLabFTW™ integration feature on another system).

## Restricted uses of "eLabFTW"

The following uses are generally prohibited without explicit and direct
permission being granted to you by Deltablot SASU. We do this to protect the
eLabFTW™ project from software and sites which could confuse people. If in
doubt, reach out for clarification: https://www.deltablot.com/contact

* You can't use the word "eLabFTW" or any eLabFTW logos for commercial purposes
  without prior written permission from Deltablot SASU.
* You can't use "eLabFTW" in the name of your software (including Mobile apps).
* You can't use "eLabFTW" in your company name.
* You can't use "eLabFTW" in your domain name.
* You can't use "eLabFTW" in advertising-related keywords (such as Adsense).
* You can't use "eLabFTW" to describe services around eLabFTW
  (such as hosting, training, support, consulting, course creation services,
  theme development, customisation, installation, integration, analytics
  and certification) that cause consumers to be confused that you are
  associated with Deltablot SASU if you are not.
  This applies even if you do not charge for the services.
  Note that usually only eLabFTW Partners have this permission.
