# Summary

eLabFTW is a free and open source electronic laboratory notebook for researchers.
Once installed on a server, it allows researchers to track their experiments, but
also to manage their assets in the lab (antibodies, mouse, siRNAs, proteins, etc.).
Experiments can be timestamp to any RFC 3161 Time Stamping Authority, allowing solid legal proof in case of issues about a patent. It also features a scheduler to book equipment. More information can be found on the official website [@Elabweb] and in the documentation [@Elabdoc]. Moreover, an online demo is accessible [@Elabdemo] to try out the software without installing.
