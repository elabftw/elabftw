# eLabFTW TRADEMARKS POLICY (Commercial Use)

## Scope (Who this applies to)

**This policy applies to commercial entities and commercial activities only.**
Individuals and organizations engaged in **non-commercial** use (e.g., research labs, universities, open-source contributors, hobby projects, internal deployments without paid offerings) may use the eLabFTW name *nominatively* to describe the software or project, provided they do **not** misrepresent affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement and do not use eLabFTW logos in a way that implies such affiliation.

> If you are unsure whether your use is commercial, see the definitions below or contact us: https://www.deltablot.com/contact

### Definitions
- **Commercial Entity**: Any person or organization that markets, sells, or monetizes products or services (including hosting, support, training, consulting, or paid add-ons).
- **Commercial Activity**: Any activity intended to generate revenue or commercial advantage, including advertising, paid placements, sales, or lead generation associated with eLabFTW.

## The eLabFTW Trademark

The brand and word “eLabFTW” has trademark protection in many countries. Various eLabFTW™ trademarks are owned by Deltablot SASU. Trademark owners must police their marks and prevent confusingly similar uses.

Because eLabFTW is open source (GNU AGPL), modified distributions may appear alongside eLabFTW branding. To avoid confusion, note that the GNU AGPL does **not** grant any license to use eLabFTW trademarks. We protect the brand so we can continue developing eLabFTW sustainably.

You can **freely use** everything in this repository under its open-source license for both non-commercial and commercial purposes, **so long as you replace trademarked content** (including, without limitation, the eLabFTW name and logo) when you do not have permission to use the trademarks.

## Allowed uses of “eLabFTW” (No Permission Required)

The following **non-commercial** uses are allowed without permission, provided there is no suggestion of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement by Deltablot SASU:

- Referring to the software or project as the “eLabFTW™ software” or the “eLabFTW™ project”.
- Describing your own **non-commercial** implementation or deployment of eLabFTW (including within corporate or academic settings when not offering paid services to third parties).
- Describing a community hub based on eLabFTW.
- Describing software you made that integrates with eLabFTW™ branded software (e.g., “an eLabFTW™ integration feature in X”), as long as branding is purely descriptive and non-commercial.

> Note: Nominative fair use is allowed. Use only what is reasonably necessary to identify the software (typically the word mark), avoid logos, and add a clarifying statement such as “Not affiliated with or endorsed by Deltablot SASU.”

## Restricted uses of “eLabFTW” (Commercial Use Only)

The following uses are **restricted for commercial entities/activities** without prior written permission from Deltablot SASU. These restrictions do **not** apply to purely non-commercial uses as described above.

- **Commercial branding**: Using the word “eLabFTW” or any eLabFTW logo in connection with commercial offerings (including websites, ads, product pages, sales decks, brochures, or paid courses).
- **Product or company naming**: Using “eLabFTW” in the name of your commercial product, service, company, or mobile app.
- **Domains**: Registering or using domain names that include “eLabFTW” for commercial purposes.
- **Advertising keywords**: Bidding on or using “eLabFTW” as an advertising keyword (e.g., in Google Ads) for commercial promotion.
- **Commercial services around eLabFTW**: Marketing hosting, training, support, consulting, course creation, theme development, customization, installation, integration, analytics, certification, or similar **paid** services using “eLabFTW” in a manner likely to cause confusion about affiliation with Deltablot SASU.
  *Note: This applies even if some or all services are discounted or temporarily free as part of a commercial lead-gen strategy. Typically, only authorized eLabFTW Partners have this permission.*

## Attribution

This policy is adapted from the MOODLE TRADEMARKS POLICY, version 4.5.0. The original eLabFTW policy text has been reorganized and clarified to limit restrictions to **commercial** entities and activities while permitting nominative, non-commercial uses that avoid confusion.
